### Problem Statement:
**Objective**: The aim of this project is to analyze customer purchase behavior using market basket analysis to help a retail business improve sales and customer satisfaction.

**Problem Statement**: The retail business seeks to understand the relationships between products purchased by customers and identify associations or patterns to make data-driven decisions. This includes optimizing product placements, cross-selling, and creating effective marketing strategies.

### Design Thinking Process:
**Design Approach**: Our approach is customer-centric, focusing on understanding customer preferences and behaviors. We used the following steps in the design thinking process:

1. **Empathize**: Gathered data on customer transactions and preferences.
2. **Define**: Defined the problem and objectives.
3. **Ideate**: Brainstormed potential associations and patterns in customer purchase data.
4. **Prototype**: Implemented association analysis techniques to identify relevant patterns.
5. **Test & Iterate**: Evaluated the discovered association rules and refined them as needed.

### Phases of Development:
**1. Data Collection**:
   - Data Source: Kaggle dataset - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis)
   - Data Description: The dataset contains transaction records of a retail store, including customer IDs, product IDs, and purchase timestamps.

**2. Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling Missing Values: Checked for and handled missing values, if any, in the dataset.
   - Data Encoding: Encoded categorical variables like product IDs.
   - Data Transformation: Converted transaction data into a suitable format for association analysis.

**3. Association Analysis Techniques**:
   - Used the Apriori algorithm for discovering association rules.
   - Set minimum support and confidence levels for rule generation.
   
**4. Discovered Association Rules**:
   - Identified significant association rules, e.g., "If customers buy product A, they are likely to buy product B."
   - Examples of discovered rules: (A -> B with confidence X% and support Y%)

**5. Business Implications**:
   - Improved Product Placement: Insights from the association rules can be used to optimize product placements in the store, promoting related products together.
   - Cross-selling: Retailers can utilize the rules to promote complementary products or offer discounts to customers based on their purchase history.
   - Targeted Marketing: The rules can guide marketing campaigns to target specific customer segments with relevant product recommendations.

### Submission:
**Project Code Files**: Compiled all code files for data preprocessing, association analysis, and rule interpretation.

**README File**: Created a well-structured README file that explains how to run the code, lists dependencies, and provides step-by-step instructions for replication.

**Dataset Source**: Mentioned the source of the dataset and provided a brief description of the data's relevance to the problem.

**GitHub Repository**: Uploaded the project to a private GitHub repository and granted access to college evaluators, faculty evaluator, and industry evaluator for the evaluation process.

By following this structure, you can create a comprehensive project documentation and submission package that effectively communicates your work and its impact.
